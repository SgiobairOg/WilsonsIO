# Wilsons IO Ecosystem

This repository is for my personal website as re-imagined in 2023. I say ecosystem as the intent is to explore my various dev disciplines through multi-interface development and APIs to share information through the site. 

This will be an incremental development starting with the basic website and expanding from there. 

## Current Status

Initial Development Starts 1st September 2023

### Web

Main web site for desktop and mobile platforms.

Initial components and layouts built in Figma, refactoring templates to better handle layout direction and translations.

Initial design system built [in figma](https://www.figma.com/file/4TnVrfoQsT9PWXwLODKIH3/WilsonsIO2023?type=design&node-id=2%3A11&mode=design&t=f0RjFRxMtfVOZNC8-1).
